        <h1>Exoplanet – Any planet beyond our solar system</h1>

        <p>Discovering thousands of planets beyond our solar system counts
          as a “eureka” moment in human exploration. But the biggest payoff is yet to
          come: capturing evidence of a distant world hospitable to life.
          We begin the search on familiar ground. On this planet, currently our sole
          example of a life-bearing world, the need for water is non-negotiable. So astronomers search the cosmos for similar environments. Around almost every “normal” star, including our sun, we can draw a band of potential habitability: the right distance and temperature for liquid water to exist. The key, of course, is a planetary surface where the water could pool. Both stars and planets come in many types and sizes, and the interplay of these factors determines the extent and influence of this “habitable zone.”</p>

          <h1>Wishing upon the right kind of star</h1>
          <p> So how is the search going?
            In just over 20 years of exploration, ground and space-based
            observations have turned up more than 3,200 confirmed exoplanets
            in the few slices of our galaxy we’ve been able to search.
            Add unconfirmed planetary candidates and the number jumps to more
            than 5,600.Many of the planets found so far are gas or ice giants, with little chance of a solid surface harboring a warm little pond. But we’ve also found some rocky worlds in Earth’s size-range. Even with the expected advances in observing technology in years to come, we’re unlikely to know the precise nature of any life we might detect, be they crusts of algae or loping, six-legged giraffes. Still, among those rocky, Earth-like worlds, we could catch tantalizing glimpses of the right conditions for life.</p>


            <p>But how can we tell if anybody's home? </p>
            <p>By looking for life in all the right places</p>
